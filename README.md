Teamviewer is a painITA if you want to make it privacy comform, anydesk is nice but crashes on terminal servers all the time and support dosnt help, so now lets do some open sourcy ;)

Tecnical details
It uses a java programmed but native compiled wrapper for tightvnc (also gpl) and tunnels through https if there is no direct connection/nat stabbing possible so it can be used everywhere without porlblems. This tunnel feature is optional cause we have good local connection in hear but i would like to find the time to do it...
